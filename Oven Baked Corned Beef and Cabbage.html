            <p class="line">Start by preheating your oven to 300°F (150°C). Rinse the corned beef to remove excess brine—this is optional, but it helps reduce the saltiness. Pat it dry with a paper towel.</p><p class="line">In a bowl, mix together the stone-ground mustard, brown sugar, and the spice packet that came with the corned beef. This mixture will add a sweet and tangy flavor, perfectly complementing the saltiness of the meat.</p><p class="line">Spread the mustard mixture generously over the top of the corned beef with the fat side up, ensuring it’s well-coated. Place it in a large Dutch oven (a roasting pan works too). Pour the low-sodium beef broth around the corned beef, being careful not to wash off the mustard mixture. This will keep the brisket moist while it cooks. Cover the pot with a lid and place it in the oven. Estimate about one hour of cooking time per pound, so for a 3 1/2 pound brisket, you’re looking at approximately 3.5 hours. (Please note that all ovens cook differently and it may take less or more time to cook completely.)</p><p class="line">With about an hour and a half left in cooking time, prepare your vegetables. Place the quartered potatoes, chopped carrots, and quartered onion on a baking sheet. Melt one stick of Kerrygold Irish butter and drizzle it over the vegetables. Season them with your favorite steak blend seasoning. Raise the oven temperature to 350°F (175°C). Place the baking sheet with vegetables on the bottom rack of the oven.</p><p class="line">With 45 minutes left, add the quartered cabbage to the pot with the corned beef. Sprinkle with a little more steak seasoning for extra flavor.</p><p class="line">Once everything is cooked, toss the vegetables and let the corned beef rest for about 10 minutes. Remember to slice the corned beef against the grain for the best texture.</p><p class="line">Start by preheating your oven to 300°F (150°C).

        <h3 class="subhead">Notes</h3>
        <div itemprop="comment" class="notes text">
            <p>For perfectly tender corned beef, it should be cooked to an internal temperature of about 190°F to 205°F (88°C to 96°C). This temperature range allows the connective tissues in the meat to break down, resulting in a tender and juicy brisket. Using a meat thermometer is the best way to ensure you reach the desired temperature.</p><p>Store leftovers in the fridge for up to 4 days in an airtight container.</p>
