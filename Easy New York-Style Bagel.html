        <h3 class="subhead">Directions</h3>
        <div itemprop="recipeInstructions" class="directions text">
            <p class="line">Making the Bagel Dough</p><p class="line">In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a dough hook, mix the flour, yeast, sugar, and salt in a large bowl on medium/low speed.</p><p class="line">Slowly add the warm water. Stir in just enough water for your dough to form a ball and clean the bottom of the bowl.</p><p class="line">Knead the dough on medium/low speed for roughly 10 minutes. While it is kneading slowly incorporate the extra 3/4 cup (3 ¾oz/105g)of flour until your dough is smooth and elastic. Try working in as much flour as possible to form a firm but stiff dough. Add a few drops of water if needed to incorporate more flour. (See video for a step by step)</p><p class="line">Lightly brush a large bowl with oil and turn the dough to coat. Cover the bowl tightly with cling wrap and a dishtowel. Let rise in a warm place for 1 hour, until the dough has doubled in size.</p><p class="line">Once doubled, punch the dough down and carefully divide the dough into 8 pieces (roughly 4oz/115g each).</p><p class="line">Shaping the Bagels</p><p class="line">Shape each piece into a smooth, round ball. Now, take a dough ball, and press it gently against the countertop moving your hand and the ball in a circular motion pulling the dough into itself while reducing the pressure on top of the dough slightly until a perfect dough ball forms. Repeat with the rest of the dough.</p><p class="line">Gently press your finger into the center of each dough ball to form a ring. Stretch the ring to about 1/2 the diameter of the bagel (around 1 1/2 inches) and place on a lined cookie sheet. Repeat the same step with the remaining dough.</p><p class="line">Once more, repeat the process of shaping the bagels as they might have sprung back into shape. (Watch video for step by step!)</p><p class="line">After shaping the dough rounds and placing them on the cookie sheet, cover with cling wrap and a towel and allow to rest for 20 minutes.</p><p class="line">Cooking the Bagels</p><p class="line">Meanwhile, preheat your oven to 425ºF (210ºC) and bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add a teaspoon of Baking soda and a tablespoon of honey to the water.</p><p class="line">Carefully place the bagels one by one into the water. Boil as many as you are comfortable with boiling. Let them boil there for 2 minutes, and then flip them over to boil for another 2 minutes. Boiling the bagel makes for that authentic chewy bread we love in a New York style bagel.</p><p class="line">Remove bagels and place them back on your lined cookie sheet. Egg wash one by one and top with the ingredients listed above or add your own flavor.</p><p class="line">Bake for about 20 minutes or until golden brown.</p><p class="line">Storing Bagels</p><p class="line">So, bagels actually aren&apos;t at there very best straight from the oven. Leave them in an airtight container overnight at room temperature and the flavor and texture are significantly better (you will see). Enjoy within 3 days or freeze for up to 8 weeks.</p>

        <h3 class="subhead">Notes</h3>
        <div itemprop="comment" class="notes text">
            <p>*Bread Flour: If you only have plain/all purpose flour then you can use that just notes though that bread flour gives you a different kind of denser bagel. Also you will need to hold back some of the liquid as all purpose flour doesn&apos;t absorb as much as bread does.</p>
